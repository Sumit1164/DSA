# 💻 Daily DSA Practice
Welcome to my Daily DSA Practice repository! 🚀
Here, I consistently upload solutions to popular Data Structures and Algorithms problems in various languages (mainly C++/Java/Python). This repo is part of my journey to sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. 🎯

# 📅 What You'll Find Here
Each day, I solve one or more DSA problems and upload:

- ✅ Clean and well-commented code

- 📂 Organized folders by topic (e.g. Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs)

- 📝 Problem statements or links (where applicable)

- 🧠 My thought process or brief explanation (coming soon!)

# 🧩 Topics Covered So Far
I’m working through a wide range of topics, including:

- 🔢 Arrays & Strings

- 🧵 Recursion & Backtracking

- 🌲 Binary Trees & BST

- 🎯 Binary Search

- 🧮 Hashing

- 📊 Stack, Queue, Linked List

- 🕸️ Graphs (BFS, DFS, etc.)

- 🧠 Dynamic Programming

…and more as I progress!

# ✍️ Why I'm Doing This
Practicing DSA daily helps build problem-solving skills, improves coding speed, and boosts confidence for technical interviews. Sharing my journey here keeps me consistent and hopefully helps others too! 🙌
